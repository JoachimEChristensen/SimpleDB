# SimpleDB
## How it works
I've built an incredibly simple databse in Java using Netbeans.

The program accepts 4 types of input. these are:

1. Insert

This input will direct you to input a string, which is then added to the database.

2. Get

This input will fetch the latest entry in the database.

3. Save

This input will save the database to a file with a name of your choosing, in the same folder as the executable.

4. Load

This input will load a file with a given name in the same folder as the , and if applicable, will replace the contents of the database with the file's contents.

## How to use

Either you build the project and get an executable you can run using Java -jar "filename"

or you run the main class in something like Netbeans, letting you experience the program in the same manner.

## Issues

Unfortunately I did not have the time to implement the hashmap and key-value pair functionality.

Furthermore, I'm uncertain if its possible to properly do so with how I've designed the program.

If my reviewer is familiar with the functionality, please lend me a little hand and teach me how it would be possible?

Thank you.
